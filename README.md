# The Five Words

The Five Words is application that helps polish-speaking people without any knowledge about english language, get familiar with almost 250 basics words.

## The purpose of the project

This is my first project after learning React.js. The main purpose was to put into practice what I have learned. I also wanted to make it useful and practical so initially the list of words was intended to be larger but lastly the practical part of the project took me a bit more time that I planned so I decided to shorten list and focus on the code.
